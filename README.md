# DuckGame
Hello there! My name is Alex and this is a personal project I have been working on for about a month now!

Obligatory backstory: one of my university professors was (and probably still is) obsessed with rubber ducks. He first introduced them to us as a method of helping us understand our programming in a better fashion by having an entity we could explain it to. The bare basis is that breaking the code down to its simplest form should be so simple that even a rubber duck would be able to understand it. So whenever anybody in our class won a quiz or did exceedingly well with some work, we earned a duck.

Unfortunately COVID-19 hit the world halfway through my second year of university and he couldn't give out any rubber ducks anymore. But the joke still lived on, and every time we got a chance we would reference the rubber ducks. It never ended through the rest of our time online, and since I ended uni I only thought it fitting to develop a project that utilised rubber ducks in some fashion. Which is what we have here: this amalgamation of rubber ducks and insanity!
