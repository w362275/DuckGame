# DuckGame
Hello there! My name is Alex and this is a personal project I have been working on for about a month now!

Obligatory backstory: one of my university professors was (and probably still is) obsessed with rubber ducks. He first introduced them to us as a method of helping us understand our programming in a better fashion by having an entity we could explain it to. The bare basis is that breaking the code down to its simplest form should be so simple that even a rubber duck would be able to understand it. So whenever anybody in our class won a quiz or did exceedingly well with some work, we earned a duck.

Unfortunately COVID-19 hit the world halfway through my second year of university and he couldn't give out any rubber ducks anymore. But the joke still lived on, and every time we got a chance we would reference the rubber ducks. It never ended through the rest of our time online, and since I ended uni I only thought it fitting to develop a project that utilised rubber ducks in some fashion. Which is what we have here: this amalgamation of rubber ducks and insanity!

The current state of the game is fairly barebones at the moment. The milestone that I set for the end of this month was to nail down the basic movement for the player and ducks scattered throughout the levels. So far there is a single level which will be used to test that all desired physics and mechanics of the game function as intended - more in-depth and structured levels will be developed following this period. With this in mind, the following criteria have been fulfilled:

 - Basic player movement
 - Basic duck movement
 - Spawning in new ducks
 - Weapon system
 - Duck health

Having achieved these goals, the game development process is entering a second stage of development that will shift to focus on the enemy's side of things. I have set the following goals for myself to achieve within the upcoming month of October:

 - Player health
 - Duck attacks (may find a mix of melee and ranged)
 - Duck varieties/different duck enemies
 - Status effects
 - Player death/respawning/restarting

Finally, the roadmap for future development. While I have not got absolutely everything set out in detail, the current plan for the game state beyond this point will look a little something like this:

 - Pick-ups/items
 - Other weapons
 - Level design
 - Difficulty scaling
 - Boss battles
 - Endgame events/bosses
 - Music(?)

I will be uploading a demo to Itch.io once the game has entered a suitable state for testing. Until then, please do feel free to browse through the scripts that I have inserted into the repository, and do let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!
